DESCRIPTION 
-----------

re2c is a free and open-source lexer generator for C and C++.

Its main goal is generating fast lexers: at least as fast as their reasonably
optimized hand-coded counterparts. Instead of using traditional table-driven
approach, re2c encodes the generated finite state automata directly in the form
of conditional jumps and comparisons. The resulting programs are faster and
often smaller than their table-driven analogues, and they are much easier to
debug and understand. re2c applies quite a few optimizations in order to speed
up and compress the generated code.

Another distinctive feature is its flexible interface: instead of assuming a
fixed program template, re2c lets the programmer write most of the interface
code and adapt the generated lexer to any particular environment.


DOCUMENTATION
-------------

Official re2c website is [re2c.org](http://re2c.org).


DOWNLOAD
--------

Release tarballs: https://github.com/skvadrik/re2c/releases

Source code:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/skvadrik/re2c.git
$ git clone https://git.code.sf.net/p/re2c/code-git
```

Github is the main repo, sourceforge is a mirror and can be slightly outdated.


BUILD
-----

The simplest possible way to build re2c is this:

```
$ ./configure [--prefix=<prefix>]
$ make
$ make install
```
See the [official documantation](http://re2c.org/install/install.html) for full details on more sophisticated build types.
If you want to build from git, you will first need to generate autotools files:

```
$ ./autogen.sh
```
